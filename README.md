DIY case inspired by the original Monome Norns

#### The case is made of three parts:
* A laser-cut top panel
* A 3D-printed shell
* A polycarbonate window for the OLED (OPTIONAl)

* EDIT Feb 2021: Added an alternate version of the top panel that fits the case that now ships with the shield.

I chose to have a top panel made out of aluminum as a nod to the original Norns, but any flat material will work. If you want an aluminum version for yourself I have some extras for sale here: https://rvrb.io/2020-aluminum-top-19qjma

The shell includes hidden ventilation slots around the top lip and on the bottom face, and is optimized to print with minimal supports. The polycarbonate window is not necessary, but looks nice, especially in smoked acrylic. The OLED window is a simple rectangle, so you could cut it yourself to save money over laser cutting. 

#### All of the hardware for the original Norns Shield case can be used. 
* The previous version of this case required 3D-printed buttons, it can now use the buttons and knobs included with the kit.
* If you'd like to use an aftermarket knob, any with diameter <12mm will work.

### Assembly Details
* If you've already built your Norns Shield, dissasemble the case and discard the 2 plastic spacers from beneath the RPi. Reserve all other hardware
* Lower the Pi+Shield assembly down into the shell. Take care not to damage the SD card holder. It is a tight fit, but it should work with some patience.
* Loosely install the 4 screws on the bottom of the shell to hold it in place. Do not tighten fully yet.
* If you have made a window for the screen, you can attach it to the top panel with some clear packing tape on the underside. Just work slowly and make sure both parts are free from dust to avoid bubbles.
* Make sure your buttons and knobs are already installed, then place the top panel+window assembly on the shield and loosely install the remaining screws.
* Adjust the positioning of the top panel so  the buttons and knobs move freely, then tighten the top screws.
* Adjust the positioning of the bottom shell to align the edges with the top panel, then tighten the bottom screws.
